The file is inside your final project repository called "README.md"

You should include in your final project readme a description of the project, a list of all the files that you have created and instructions for use.

This readme is written in a language called markdown. This is not a programming language but a formatting langauge. There are symbols (syntax) used to indicate how to format the text. For example the pound symbol (i.e. the hashtag) is used to format a title; two of the same symbol format a heading, and three format a sub-heading.

Below is some example text in markdown however this alone is not suffiecent for the final project. **Make sure you follow the directions on Canvas.**

# Final Project: Material Identification

Our project focuses on classifying and identifying unknown materials. Most materials have some level of variance in their property measurements, so it is not always so simple to identify which material you have. Ensuring that this identification is correct can prevent future errors in process design and manufacturing. Our project is designed to identify and classify unknown materials. It will classify a material when provided information on the properties of a material. 

---------------------------------------------

## Instructions

- Open Final_Project.py and run the script (nothing will happen). 
- Open Final_Project_driver.py and run the script.
- Program will ask for the user's density, modulus of elasticity, and strength of their unknown material
- Enter one of the test cases given in the driver code
- Or, enter your own test case which must be within the range of the property (you can look at the min/max variables)
- The script will ask whether or not you want the graphs and tables to be interactive (which allows you to rotate the 3D graph)
- To be interactive, type 'yes', and to stay within the script, say 'no'
- If you say 'no' and then want to say 'yes', you must restart the kernel, but it is fine to say 'yes' and then 'no'
- The script will return the top three most likely materials, indicated with scores from 0 to 100, as well as a table of the average properties of each material

## How to format your readme

In your readme, you can:
```
Give code examples
```

You can also include useful links, like this one with information about [formatting markdown](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
